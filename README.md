# The Falsetto Protocol

The Falsetto Protocol is a chat protocol, inspired by Matrix and Discord. It's fully free and can be implemented by anybody. Servers using the protocol are designed to federate, which allows for multiple self-hosted instances to connect with each other.

The protocol is still in development. Things may be added, removed or changed. There's a changelog at the beggining of the protocol that contains 5 of the most recent changes. We reccomend using the stable release, and upgrading when a new one is available. Copying the previous version and checking the differences between the files (for example, using ``diff``) can also help.

> Warning! The next update will introduce a lot of breaking changes, and may be largely incompatible with Public Draft 2. If you're planning to implement the protocol, read the in-dev version and keep track of any updates. (These changes are made because I am currently working on drywall, and as such the new version will be easier to implement and use.)

The current stable version of the Falsetto Protocol is **Public Draft 2**. You can read the protocol by clicking on one of the buttons below.
