# The Euphony Project

The Euphony Project is a project that aims to create an open communication protocol.

It comprises of three parts:

- The Euphony Protocol, the protocol that powers the project;
- Drywall, the refference implementation of a server
- [name undecided], the official web client

The Euphony Project is still heavily WIP. Some things may be missing or not explained well enough. If you find any inconsistency, please make a new issue on the GitHub repository.

## The Euphony Protocol

The current stable version of the Euphony Protocol is **Public Draft 1**. It has been released on **31-12-2019**.

While you can read this initial release [here](https://github.com/knuxify/euphony-project/blob/7d88f4987e918a6def395d4ed1326d02dfadcdc5/PROTOCOL.md), it is generally reccomended that you read the most up-to-date in-dev version of the protocol by clicking on the link below.

## Drywall

As of now, the Drywall server is still under development. The initial preview should be out before the end of January 2020. If you're interested in helping with development (which will be done in Python), contact the project's maintainer.

## Web client

As of now, the web client is still under development. The initial preview should be out before the end of March 2020. If you're interested in helping with development (which will be done in Python), contact the project's maintainer.
