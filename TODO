# Euphony Project TODO

- Find a new name for the project
  * Colon? Too much like a body part.

- Find a new name for "servers".
  * I've been considering "portals" but it's really cheesy.
  * Community? Group? They both conflict with the normal words (community as in opensource help, group as in direct dm group?)
  * Heck, even Discord calls them "guilds" internally!

- Finish the object info tables.
  * Also, test if they even work.

- Add more API endpoints
  * Most notably, for servers, messages and attachments.

- Add attachements and channels to the spec.
  * Somehow, they're not here yet.
