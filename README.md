# The Falsetto Protocol

The Falsetto Protocol is a chat protocol, inspired by Matrix and Discord. It's fully free and can be implemented by anybody. Servers using the protocol are designed to federate, which allows for multiple self-hosted instances to connect with each other.

The current stable version of the Falsetto Protocol is **Public Draft 2**. You can read the protocol by clicking on one of the buttons below.
