# The Falsetto Protocol

The Falsetto Protocol is a chat protocol, inspired by Matrix and Discord. It's fully free and can be implemented by anybody. Servers using the protocol are designed to federate, which allows for multiple self-hosted instances to connect with each other.

The protocol is still in development. Things may be added, removed or changed. There's a changelog at the beggining of the protocol that contains 5 of the most recent changes. We reccomend using the stable release, and upgrading when a new one is available. Copying the previous version and checking the differences between the files (for example, using ``diff``) can also help.

The current stable version of the Falsetto Protocol is **Public Draft 2**. You can read the protocol by clicking on one of the buttons below.
