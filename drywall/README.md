# drywall

``drywall`` is the example server-side implementation of the Euphony protocol. It is designed to comply with the Euphony protocol. Addendum features may be added, if this server becomes the de-facto standard for Euphony servers (a.k.a. my amateur code won't be rewritten).

## Why the name ``drywall``?

Because this is a bare-bones demonstration of the protocol (at least for now). It may be changed in the future, but it depends on whether I'll be able to find a decent replacement name.
