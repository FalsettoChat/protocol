# The Euphony Project

The Euphony Project is a project that aims to create an open communication protocol, with simmilar features to Discord.

It comprises of three parts:

- The Euphony Protocol, the protocol that powers the project;
- The Bubble server, the refference implementation of a server
- [name undecided], the official web client

The Euphony Project is still heavily WIP. Some things may be missing or not explained well enough. If you find any inconsistency, please make a new issue on the GitHub repository.
