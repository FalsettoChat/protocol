## Introduction

The Euphony Protocol is a chat protocol, inspired by Matrix and Discord. It's fully free and can be implemented by anybody. Servers using the protocol are designed to federate, which allows for multiple self-hosted instances to connect with each other.

The main goal of this project is to create a chat platform that is transparent and easy to implement, while retaining many functions that other software does not have (such as conferences - groups with channels in them).

### Recent changes

- added bot accounts
- cleared up information about API method authentication
- added API methods for banning, kicking and blocking
- added API methods for invites
- added invites, blocks and user-specific information
- cleared up information about stashing - additional things to implement, see the ``Federation`` > ``Stashing`` section.

## Keywords

- User - User of an instance.
- Account - An account on an instance. Only used when mentioning the object type.
- Instance - The instance (running a Euphony Project compatible server).
- Conference - A group that contains channels.
- Channel - A channel of communication. DMs and group chats are also channels.
- Message - A single message, placed in a text channel.

Additional note: all JSON fields that use "..." as the name are intended to be comments and should be ignored.

### Example keywords

Note: if only one user/instance/conference/action is mentioned in the example, use the full words. Only use these keywords for examples in which multiple objects exist.

- Ux - User. The x is a number assigned to each user in the example.
- Ix - Instance. The x is a number assigned to each instance in the example.
- Cx - Conference. The x is a number assigned to each conference in the example.
- Ox - Object. The x is a number assigned to each object in the example.

## Dates

All dates MUST be stored in the ISO 8601 format. Any dates provided in any values MUST match this format.

## Objects and IDs

Users, conferences, channels and messages are objects.

Every object MUST have a unique ID, which allows it to be quickly located and accessed. These IDs can be strings or numbers, depending on the implementation. Object IDs MUST NOT overlap. You **cannot** change an object's ID once it's been assigned.

Information about IDs can be accessed through

```url
/api/v1/id/<ID>
```

In the Euphony Project, the main hierarchy of objects is as follows (from largest/most important to smallest/least important):

- Instance (running a Euphony Project compatible server) - this MUST have the numerical ID of 0
- User (somebody who uses the service)
- Role (groups together certain people in a conference)
- Conference (a group containing channels, compare to Discord's servers/guilds)
- Channel (which contains messages, compare to IRC/Matrix channels or channels in a Discord server/guild)
- Attachment (as in, a quote, poll or other kinds of embeds)
- Message

Each object, when retrieved, MUST contain the ``id`` value (set as a number) containing the object's ID, and a ``type`` value set to ``"object"``, for example:

```json
{
 "id": 1,
 "type": "object",
 "...": "...insert any additional values..."
}
```

### Example

An application wants to get information about a user. To do so, it must first find its object ID. Once located, this ID can be used to access information about the user, even if they change their name.

### Retrieving information about IDs

To get information about an object/action based on its ID, you can query the API:

```url
/api/v1/id/<ID>
```

where ``<ID>`` is the ID you want to get information on. This will return a request that will look as follows:

```json
{
 "id": 1,
 "...": "...insert any required values..."
}
```

where 1 is the ID you requested.

In order to prevent abuse, ALL IDS except for 0 MUST NOT be accessible without prior authentication.

## Federation

Each instance MUST have a public inbox (which can be written to by other instances) and SHOULD have a private outbox (where requests that will be sent to other instances are stashed).

Federation works on the following principle:

Each channel can be subscribed to, which means that the remote instance knows that it has to send data to another. Instances stash content that has to be sent to other instances' inboxes in a private outbox.

The inbox is located at

```url
/api/v1/federation/inbox
```

and, upon being queried with a GET request, it MUST return information about the instance (ID 0).

To send an ID to another server, the ID's content is simply POSTed to the remote instance's inbox.

When a remote object is saved on the local instance, it is assigned a local ID and turns into a regular local object. The remote ID and domain are kept in the ``remote-domain`` and ``remote-id`` values.

An example of an ID that was recieved from another instance:

```json
{
 "id": 1,
 "remote-domain": "remote.domain",
 "remote-id": 4,
 "...": "...insert any required values..."
}
```

### Example

U1 wants to join a conference. U1 is on I1, while the conference is on I2. I1 isn't subscribed to the conference yet, so it sends a request to I2 asking to be subscribed to the server. If I2 doesn't block I1 and I2 is up, I1 will subscribe to the conference on I2, thus allowing U1 to communicate with people in the conference.

### Stashing

When the remote server can't be contacted, the local server creates a stash list, which contains the ID ranges that have to be sent to the remote server. It pings the remote server every X minutes (recommended default: 10 minutes) and if it gets a connection, it sends it the stashed requests. If a server is down for more than 7 days, it is considered closed, until any request is received back.

To ease this process, servers can send a request to another letting them know that they're back online. This will mark the server as "back online" and tell the remote server to send information to the previously-closed server. It is recommended that server software checks for connection dropouts and, once identified, waits for the dropout to end, then send the resync request once the connection is available.

As such, this concept covers two cases:

- one of the servers temporarily drops the connection but is still running
- one of the servers is shut down

#### Server status requests

To check if an instance is available, servers can send a GET request to the instance's inbox. This should return information about the instance. If any information is received, the instance is considered up; otherwise, it's considered down.

#### Sending stashed IDs

In order to improve general speeds and reduce bandwidth waste, stashed IDs use their own format, which allows them to be sent to the remote server in one request. This format is NOT an object; instead, it uses its own type, named ``stash``. Here is an example stash layout:

```json
{
 "type": "stash",
 "5": [{
 "id": 5,
 "type": "object",
 "...": "...insert any required information..."
 }],
 "6": [{
 "id": 6,
 "type": "object",
 "...": "...insert any required information..."
 }]
}
```

Stashes are sent to the remote server's inbox.

> :warning: Don't send IDs to the remote server that aren't supposed to go to it! It's a waste of bandwidth and a potential security threat, as bad actors may attempt to intercept information that way.

### Requesting resources from another instance

Servers must request access to information through the following endpoint on the remote server:

```url
/api/v1/federation/request/...
```

where ``...`` is the same as any API call you would usually make, without the ``/api/v1/`` prefix.

For example, to request an account by name, you would use:

```url
/api/v1/federation/request/account/by-name/U1
```

The remote server will then proceed to send the requested information to the local server's inbox, instead of returning it directly.

### Accessing information about remote instances

When an instance begins to federate with another instance, its ID 0 is copied to

```url
/api/v1/federation/$remotedomain
```

where ``$remotedomain`` is the remote instance's domain.

When queried, this will return the equivalent of the remote server's ID 0 (which contains information about the instance).

``GET $domain/api/v1/federation/$remotedomain``

```json
{
 "id": 0,
 "type": "object",
 "object-type": "instance",
 "...": "...insert instance-specific information here..."
}
```

Assuming an object/action has federated to the instance, it is possible to retrieve its ID on the server it has federated to using

```url
/api/v1/federation/$remotedomain/ID
```

Where ``ID`` is the ID from the remote domain.

This will automatically locate the right ID and print the required information.

``GET $domain/api/v1/federation/$remotedomain/$ID``

```json
{
 "remote-domain": "Domain from which the ID was recieved",
 "remote-id": "ID on remote server (number)",
 "id": "ID on local server",
 "...": "...insert other object/action specific information..."
}
```

## Users/Accounts

Users are stored as Account objects. An account can own messages, direct message channels and conferences.

### Blocking

> TODO: Expand on this.

Users can block other users.

###Â Bots

Bot accounts can be marked as such by setting the ``bot?`` bool to ``true`` and the ``bot-owner`` to the bot owner's account ID.

Unlike normal users, bots can be invited to conferences (through the ``/api/v1/accounts/$ID/invite`` endpoint) and cannot be logged into. Servers SHOULD implement a way to remotely modify the bot's account information.

## Conferences

A conference is a group comprising of any amount of text and voice channels. Users can join a conference, and roles can be given to them. These roles can have certain permissions assigned to them.

### Invites

Users can join a conference through an invite. Invites can be created through the ``POST /api/v1/conference/<ID>/invites`` API method.

Invites can be listed through the ``GET /api/v1/conference/<ID>/invites`` API method.

Invites are objects. The invite name SHOULD be changeable. There MUST NOT be multiple invites with the same link on one instance.

### Users

When a user joins a conference and they aren't banned, their ID is added to the conference's user list and they have their conference permission set to 1. Each user can then have additional information assigned to their account:

- their conference-specific nickname;
- the roles they're part of;
- the permissions they have been assigned;
- their ban state (banned or not).

This information can be found by querying ``/api/v1/conference/<ID1>/users/<ID2>``, where ``<ID1>`` is the conference's ID and ``<ID2>`` is the user's ID.

This information is stored in an object with the type "conference-user".

See more information about this object in the List of objects with properties.

#### Banning

A user can be banned from a conference. This means they cannot join or access the conference.

If a user was banned, their ID can still be queried through the API endpoint, but only contains the following information:

- "banned?" - bool, true
- "permissions" with the conference bit set to 0

These are set by the server at ban time.

## Channels

Channels are channels of communication that can be nested within conferences or stay standalone as group DMs. There are three types of channels: text channels, media channels (voice and video chat) and direct message channels.

Channels have the ``object-type`` of ``channel``.

### Channel types

#### Text channels

Text channels have the ``channel-type`` of ``text``. They are capable of storing messages.

Text channels MUST be attached to a conference. The conference the channel is placed in is stored in the ``parent-conference`` value.

#### Media channels

Media channels have the ``channel-type`` of ``media``. They are used for the transport of voice and video. They MUST be attached to a conference. The conference the channel is placed in is stored in the ``parent-conference`` value.

> TODO: How are audio and video going to be transported? Do some research on this.

#### Direct message channels

Direct message channels can transport both text and media. They have the same API calls as both text and media channels. They have the ``channel-type`` of ``direct-message``.

Direct message channels MUST NOT be attached to a conference. The ``parent-conference`` MUST be ignored when paired with direct message channels.

#### Categories

Categories have the ``channel-type`` of ``category``. They can group text and media channels in a conference.

Categories MUST be attached to a conference. The conference the channel is placed in is stored in the ``parent-conference`` value.

### Messages

Text channels and direct message channels can store messages. These messages can then be retrieved in two ways: by post date and by ID.

```url
/api/v1/channel/messages/{by-date/by-id}/{date/ID}
```

## Attachments

Attachments are objects that can be attached to a message for additional information. The following attachment types are available:

### Quote

```json
{
 "attachment-type": "quote",
 "quoted-message": "id"
}
```

Adds a quote to a message. Should be displayed before the message. Can be used as a reply function.

### Media

```json
{
 "attachment-type": "media",
 "media-link": "https://link-to-media/image.png"
}
```

Adds media to the message. Should be displayed after the message.

Media is one of the following:

- an image (in which case, it SHOULD be embedded as such)
- a video (in which case, it SHOULD be embedded as such)
- a sound file (in which case, it SHOULD be embedded as such)
- any other file

Any image, video or sound links SHOULD be interpreted as an attachment and embedded accordingly.

## Permissions

Permissions are stored in a single string value using numbers, where each number represents a permission set. This value is called a permission map and has the following layout:

``"permissions": 12345``

- 1 - message
- 2 - channel
- 3 - conference
- 4 - roles
- 5 - user

Permissions can be assigned to a conference, a channel, a role or a user in a conference. The order in which permissions are read and overwritten is as follows (from the least to the most important):

- conference
- channel
- role
- user in a conference

The RECOMMENDED initial permission map for a user in a conference is ``21101``.

Permission maps MUST be stored in strings, to prevent trailing ``0``s from being cut.

### List of permission sets

#### Message

- 0 - cannot read or write
- 1 - can read
- 2 - can read and write
- 3 - can pin or delete other user's messages

#### Channel

- 0 - cannot see the channel
- 1 - can see the channel, but can't read/write from/to it
- 2 - can read and write in the channel
- 3 - can modify channels

#### Conference

- 0 - cannot access the conference (user banned or conference password-locked and no/wrong password provided)
- 1 - can access the conference
- 2 - can modify the conference

#### Role

- 0 - cannot modify or assign roles
- 1 - can modify or assign roles

#### User

- 0 - cannot modify nicknames of, kick or ban users
- 1 - can change their nickname but can't modify other users
- 2 - can modify other users' and their nicknames
- 3 - can modify other users' and their nicknames and kick
- 4 - can modify other users' and their nicknames, kick and ban

## Messages

Messages are single messages in a text channel. They MUST be attached to a text channel, the ID of which is stored in the ``channel-id`` value.
